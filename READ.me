How to get this in two piss-easy steps:

1. If you don't have git installed, google for the instructions and follow them. There's tons of tutorials floating about.

2. Open the terminal/command line, copypasta and execute the following line ('execute' means hit Enter):

git clone https://github.com/w3nd1go/Wallpapers.git

This will download all the walls to your PC/Mac/Abacus, you're done.
Enjoy.
